# Data607FinalProject

Citi Bike is New York City’s bike share system, and the largest in the nation. Citi Bike launched in May 2013 and now consists of 750 stations across Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Jersey City. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. They provide a low-cost, environmentally-friendly transportation alternative for New York City.

##Introduction
This project looks at the trips taken on Citibike in September 2017. I’ll look at the commuting trends between Citibike annual subscribers and day-pass users, including trip duration, start and stop stations, and busiest times for travel.

Citibike Annual Subscribers pay $163 a year for unlimited 45 minute rides.

Day-pass users, or “Customers”, have the option of purchasing 24 hr or 3 day passes with the service. Both offer umlimited 30 minute rides within the time period purchased.
